class Tree(GFlowNetEnv):
    """
    GFlowNet environment representing a decision tree.

    Constructing a tree consists of a combination of macro steps (picking a leaf
    to split using a given feature, threshold, and children probabilities), which are divided
    into a series of consecutive micro steps (1 - pick a leaf, 2 - (dummy) pick leaf
    probability, 3 - pick a feature, 4 - pick a threshold, 5 - pick a positive class
    probability of the left child, 6 - pick a positive class probability of the right child),
    7 - (dummy) pick triplet of (parent, left child, right child). A consequence
    of that is, as long as a macro step is not in progress, the tree constructed so
    far is always a valid decision tree, which means that forward-looking loss etc. can
    be used.

    Two dummy actions are introduced in the forward step, because they are necessary to
    correctly model backward transitions. Specifically, which actions are meaningful in
    either forward or backward step was described below:

    ACTIONS                   | FORWARD | BACKWARD
    -----------------------------------------------
    select leaf               |    ✓    |    ✗    |
    select leaf probability   |    ✗    |    ✓    |
    select feature            |    ✓    |    ✗    |
    select feature threshold  |    ✓    |    ✗    |
    select left probability   |    ✓    |    ✗    |
    select right probability  |    ✓    |    ✗    |
    select triplet            |    ✗    |    ✓    |

    Internally, the tree is represented as a fixed-shape tensor (thus, specifying
    the maximum depth is required), with nodes indexed from k = 0 to 2**max_depth - 2,
    and each node containing a 5-element attribute tensor (see class Attribute for
    details). The nodes are indexed from top left to bottom right, as follows:

                0
        1               2
    3       4       5       6

    States are represented by a tensor with shape [n_nodes + 1, 5], where each k-th row
    corresponds to the attributes of the k-th node of the tree. The last row contains
    the information about the stage of the tree (see class Stage).

        Defines the structure of the output of the policy model, from which an
        action is to be determined or sampled. It initializes the output tensor
        by using the parameters provided in the argument params.

        The output of the policy of a Tree environment consists of a discrete and
        continuous part. The discrete part (first part) corresponds to the discrete
        actions, while the continuous part (second part) corresponds to the single
        continuous action, that is the sampling of the threshold of a node classifier.

        The latter is modelled by a mixture of Beta distributions. Therefore, the
        continuous part of the policy output is vector of dimensionality c * 3,
        where c is the number of components in the mixture (self.components).
        The three parameters of each component are the following:

          1) the weight of the component in the mixture
          2) the logit(alpha) parameter of the Beta distribution to sample the
             threshold.
          3) the logit(beta) parameter of the Beta distribution to sample the
             threshold.

        Note: contrary to other environments where there is a need to model a mixture
        of discrete and continuous distributions (for example to consider the
        possibility of sampling the EOS action instead of a continuous action), there
        is no such need here because either the continuous action is the only valid
